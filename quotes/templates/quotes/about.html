            <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two
                pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the
                philosophy of science.</p>
            <p>Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein's most famous equation is E=mcÂ², which expresses the
                idea that mass and energy are interchangeable. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his
                explanation of the photoelectric effect.</p>
            <p>Beyond his scientific contributions, Einstein was known for his philosophical views on life, his advocacy
                for civil rights, and his outspoken pacifism.</p>
